# 2x2_sim
Wrappers for ArgonCube 2x2 simulation designed to be run at NERSC.

Support for other computing clusters/environments using Singularity is in progress. For certain parts of the simulation chain (e.g. edep-sim) require large input files and need to be downloaded from NERSC or regenerated.

A tutorial on how to run the simulation can be found at [Tutorial on running 2x2_sim](https://github.com/DUNE/2x2_sim/wiki/Tutorial-on-running-2x2_sim) hosted on the repository wiki.
