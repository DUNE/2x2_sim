# 2x2_sim
Wrappers for ArgonCube 2x2 simulation designed to be run at NERSC.

Support for other computing clusters/environments using Singularity is now available and is configured by environment variable(s). Certain parts of the simulation chain (e.g. edep-sim) require large input files and need to be downloaded from NERSC or regenerated.

The repository wiki has a variety of useful information related to running and using the 2x2 simulation:

+ A tutorial on how to run the simulation can be found at [Tutorial on running 2x2_sim](https://github.com/DUNE/2x2_sim/wiki/Tutorial-on-running-2x2_sim)
+ Information on the data/variables inside the different output files can be found at [File data definitions](https://github.com/DUNE/2x2_sim/wiki/File-data-definitions)

Additional information may be found on the [ND-Prototype Analysis page(s)](https://wiki.dunescience.org/wiki/ND_Prototype_Analysis) on the DUNE wiki.
